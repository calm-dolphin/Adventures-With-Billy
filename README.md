# Adventures-With-Billy
A sample project in Codea making use of the Unit UI library. Requires the Unit-UI project to be marked as a dependency. It's a simple 2D top-down grid system with simple assets I made myself. It's only purpose at the moment is to demonstrate the functionality of Unit.

It's a bit messy at the moment, especially when it comes to how it uses assets, so just ignore everything but the way it uses Unit please :)
